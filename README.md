Familial Storm:

This project showcases a platformer created in Unity via C#.

The unique gimmick of this game is that you select the order in which you will receive your upgrades, allowing you to gain a double jump before a dash, or vice versa.

In total there are three abilities to receive: Double Jump, Dash, and Wall Jumping.
